 - answers file contains answers to all answers except 11 , 12 and 5 as they are implementation based
 - 11 , 12 and 5 are in seperate file
 - screenshots of ans 11 and 12 are also committed.
 - I have attached the screenshots as well of ans 11 and 12 because it may happen that some buttons or text go up or down,        depending upon the browser and screen orientation.
